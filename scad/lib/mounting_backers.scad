Using this module: 
    This module imports the various mounting systems created within the QuackWorks repo and generates a "backer plate" with that standard. The backer plate is a flat plate intended to be attached to the back of various items to be mounted. 
    Parameters below should be passed to the main module to appear in the customizer.
    Primary inputs are width and height.
    distanceBetweenSlots is indicative to the grid size and drives the distance between slots or other mounting points.
